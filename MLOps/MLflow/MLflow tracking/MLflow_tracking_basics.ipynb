In this notebook, we will walk through the process of using MLflow to track machine learning experiments. We will use the Iris dataset and perform dimensionality reduction followed by clustering, logging all relevant information to MLflow.\n",

    "- **Metrics:** Performance measurements, such as accuracy or loss, that help evaluate the model.\n",
    "- **Artifacts:** Output files or models generated during the experiment, like plots, model files, or logs.\n",

    "  - **run_id (str, optional):** If specified, resumes the run with the given ID instead of creating a new run.\n",
    "  - **experiment_id (str, optional):** Specifies the experiment under which to create the run. If not specified, the active experiment or the default experiment is used.\n",
    "  - **run_name (str, optional):** A descriptive name for the run. It can make it easier to identify runs in the UI.\n",

    "  - **sk_model (object):** The Scikit-learn model to log.\n",
