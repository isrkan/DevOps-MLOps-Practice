# The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) file requests storage resources from Kubernetes. It allows the pod to use persistent storage that survives pod restarts.
# The PVC is declared first because it requests storage resources from the Kubernetes cluster. This storage must be allocated and available before any pod that relies on it can be started. The following Deployment needs to reference this PVC to mount the storage volume.
apiVersion: v1  # The PVC API version is v1 because it is a core Kubernetes resource available since the initial stable release
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim  # Indicates that this is a PersistentVolumeClaim object
metadata:
  name: mysql-pvc  # Name of the PVC
spec:
  accessModes:  # Specifies how the volume can be accessed
    - ReadWriteOnce  # Access mode for the volume (read and write by a single node)
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Mi  # Amount of storage requested for the volume
